Inside the Angular client2 folder, we have many services in the _services folder. Your job is to write all the methods to connect 
API to client side. There are many routes in the API, and you will write those methods to connect them in the client2 _services folder.

You don't need to worry about the UI, you just need to write the method, we already have a demo in the _services/_authS, and we also have interfaces. Make sure You
use those.
